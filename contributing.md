# Contribution Guidelines
Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the list is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[List name](link) - Description shorter than 150 characters.`
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure there is no trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category except for:
- tutorials: ordered by content specificity
- games: ordered by release dates
- artists: ordered alphabetically by first name

Thank you for your PR!
